We'll provide:

A view of all of the comments
A form to submit a comment
Hooks for you to provide a custom backend
It'll also have a few neat features:

Optimistic commenting: comments appear in the list before they're saved on the server so it feels fast.
Live updates: other users' comments are popped into the comment view in real time.
Markdown formatting: users can use Markdown to format their text.
